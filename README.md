# AsphaltPlatforms
Adds Asphalt Platforms to Terraria using tModLoader. These boost your speed in the same way asphalt blocks do, but also allow you to pass through them.
Forums thread [here](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/asphalt-platforms.75675/#post-1695456).

If you need to install tModLoader, a guide can be found [here](https://github.com/blushiemagic/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-Guide).
Once you have installed tModLoader you can download ingame through the mod browser. Just search for the name of this mod, and click download.
